My Dream Man\
My "Dream Man" should, first of all be very <ADJECTIVE> and <ADJECTIVE>. He should have a physique like <CELEBRITY>, a profile like <CELEBRITY>, and the intelligence of a/an <ANIMAL>. He must be polite and must always remember to <VERB> my <NOUN>, to tip his <NOUN> and to take my <PART OF BODY> when crossing the street. He should move <ADVERB>, have a/an <ADJECTIVE> voice, and should always dress <ADVERB>. I would also like him to be a/an <ADJECTIVE> dancer, and when we are alone he should whisper <ADJECTIVE> nothings into my <PART OF BODY> and hold my <ADJECTIVE NOUN>. I know a/an <NOUN> is hard to find. In fact the only one I can think of is <PERSON> }

Camping Letter
Dear <RELATIVE>,
I am having a(n) <ADJECTIVE> time at camp. The counselor is <ADJECTIVE> and the food is <ADJECTIVE>. I met <PERSON> and we became <ADJECTIVE> friends. Unfortunately, <PERSON> is <ADJECTIVE> and I <VERB-ED> my <BODY PART> so we couldn`t go <VERB-ING> like everybody else. I need more <NOUN(S)> and a <NOUN> sharpener, so please <ADVERB> <VERB> more when you <VERB> back.
Your <RELATIVE>,
<PERSON>

My Dream Man
My "Dream Man" should, first of all be very <ADJECTIVE> and <ADJECTIVE>.
He should have a physique like <CELEBRITY>, a profile like <CELEBRITY>,
and the intelligence of a/an <ANIMAL>. He must be polite and must always
remember to <VERB> my <NOUN>, to tip his <NOUN> and to take my <PART OF BODY>
when crossing the street. He should move <ADVERB>,
have a/an <ADJECTIVE> voice, and should always dress <ADVERB>.
I would also like him to be a/an <ADJECTIVE> dancer, and when we
are alone he should whisper <ADJECTIVE> nothings into my <PART OF BODY>
and hold my <NOUN>. I know a/an <NOUN> is hard to find. In fact
the only one I can think of is <PERSON>
